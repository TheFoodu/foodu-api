## Introduction

Foodu is a B2B marketplace to connect food trucks with venues & event planners â€“ giving them a platform for data-driven decision making. Using the Foodu platform, food trucks will be able to manage their bookings, request new venues and engage with customers.

The Foodu API provides the [Foodu mobile application] (https://github.com/TheFoodu/foodu/) access to the Foodu booking database.
